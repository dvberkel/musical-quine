A musical quine.

Idea
----

A [*quine*][quine], as popularized by [Douglas Hofstadter][douglas],
is a

> non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy
> of its own source code as its only output.

Background
----------

At [Joy of Coding][joc] 2015 I spoke with the brilliant
[Bonnie Eisenman][bonnie]. She had given a workshop on musical
programming with [ChucK][chuck]. We came to discuss an idea she
attributed to [Chris Granger][chris], we gave the morning key note.

The idea Chris had mentioned in his key note wat that of a *musical
quine*. This idea really appealed to Bonnie so she ended up discussing
it with me.

I found it a really cute idea, but had a hard time coming up with an
angle of attack at the moment. Over the next few days a solution path
presented itself to me.
